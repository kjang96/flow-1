1.  Local Installation 
**********************

To get Flow running, you need three things: Flow,
SUMO, and (recommended to explore the full suite of Flow's capabilities) 
a reinforcement learning library (RLlib/rllab).
If you choose not to install a reinforcement learning library, you will 
still be able to build and run SUMO-only traffic tasks, but will not be
able to run experiments which require learning agents. Once
each component is installed successfully, you might get some missing
module bugs from Python. Just install the missing module using
your OS-specific package manager / installation tool. Follow the 
shell commands below to get started.

**It is highly recommended that users install**
`Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/download>`_ **or**
`Miniconda <https://conda.io/miniconda.html>`_
**for Python and the setup instructions will assume that you are
doing so.**

a. Installing Flow and SUMO
===========================

In this section we install Flow as well as the binaries and packages needed
to support the traffic simulator used in modeling the dynamics of traffic
networks: SUMO.

We begin by creating a conda environment and installing Flow and its
dependencies within the environment. This can be done by running the below
script.

::

    # create a conda environment
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    source activate flow
    # install flow within the environment
    python setup.py develop

Next, we install the necessary SUMO binaries and python tools. The below
commands walk you through installing and building SUMO locally. Note that
if this does not work, you are recommended to point an issue on the flow-dev
message board or refer to SUMO's
`documentation <http://sumo.dlr.de/wiki/Installing/Linux_Build>`_ regarding
installing their software. In additional, if you are interested in trying a
simpler and faster set of experimental setup instructions involving installing
pre-compiled binaries, we refer you to section 1.c.

We begin by downloading SUMO's github directory:

::

    cd ~
    git clone https://github.com/eclipse/sumo.git
    cd sumo
    git checkout 1d4338ab80
    make -f Makefile.cvs

If you have OSX, run the following commands

::

    export CPPFLAGS=-I/opt/X11/include
    export LDFLAGS=-L/opt/X11/lib
    ./configure CXX=clang++ CXXFLAGS="-stdlib=libc++ -std=gnu++11" --with-xerces=/usr/local --with-proj-gdal=/usr/local
    make -j$nproc
    echo 'export SUMO_HOME="$HOME/sumo"' >> ~/.bash_profile
    echo 'export PATH="$HOME/sumo/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
    echo 'export PYTHONPATH="$HOME/sumo/tools:$PYTHONPATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
    source ~/.bash_profile

If you have Ubuntu 14.04+, run the following command

::

    ./configure
    make -j$nproc
    echo 'export SUMO_HOME="$HOME/sumo"' >> ~/.bashrc
    echo 'export PATH="$HOME/sumo/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
    echo 'export PYTHONPATH="$HOME/sumo/tools:$PYTHONPATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.bashrc

Finally, test your SUMO install and version by running the following commands

::

    which sumo
    sumo --version
    sumo-gui

If you are a mac user and the above command gives you the error ``FXApp:openDisplay``: unable to open display :0.0 make sure to open the application XQuartz.

b. Testing the Installation
===========================

Once the above modules have been successfully installed, we can test the
installation by running a few examples. Before trying to run any examples, be
sure to enter your conda environment by typing:

::

    source activate flow

Let’s see some traffic action:

::

    python examples/sumo/sugiyama.py

Running the following should result in the loading of the SUMO GUI.
Click the run button and you should see unstable traffic form after a
few seconds, a la (Sugiyama et al, 2008). This means that you have Flow
properly configured with SUMO and Flow!


c. Testing your installation (Ray RLlib)
========================================

See `getting started with RLlib <http://ray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rllib.html#getting-started>`_ for sample commands.

To run any of the RL examples, make sure to run

::

    source activate flow

In order to test run an Flow experiment in RLlib, try the following command:

::

    python examples/rllib/stabilizing_the_ring.py

If it does not fail, this means that you have Flow properly configured with
RLlib.

To visualize the training progress:

::

    tensorboard --logdir=~/ray_results

For information on how to deploy a cluster, refer to the `Ray instructions <http://ray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autoscaling.html>`_.
The basic workflow is running the following locally, ssh-ing into the host machine, and starting
jobs from there.

::

    ray create_or_update scripts/ray_autoscale.yaml
    ray teardown scripts/ray_autoscale.yaml


d. Testing your installation (rllab-multiagent)
===============================================

To run any of the RL examples, make sure to run

::

    source activate flow
    
In order to test run an Flow experiment in rllab-multiagent, try the following
command:

::

    python examples/rllab/stabilizing_the_ring.py

If it does not fail, this means that you have Flow properly configured with
rllab-multiagent.


e. Easy Install SUMO (optional)
===============================

In this section, we present and faster and simpler method of installing the
necessary SUMO binaries and python tools. These setup instructions are still
experimental, so any and all feedback is greatly appreciated!

In order to install everything you will need from SUMO, run one of the below
scripts from the Flow main directory. Choose the script that matches the
operating system you are running.

For Ubuntu 14.04:

::

    scripts/setup_sumo_ubuntu1404.sh

For Ubuntu 16.04:

::

    scripts/setup_sumo_ubuntu1604.sh

For Ubuntu 18.04:

::

    scripts/setup_sumo_ubuntu1804.sh

For Mac:

::

    scripts/setup_sumo_osx.sh

If you are using an unsupported operating system (e.g. Arch Linux), or the
binaries provided by the above scripts are no compatible with your machine, you
will have to personally build the SUMO binary files. For more, please see
section 1.a or refer to SUMO's
`documentation <http://sumo.dlr.de/wiki/Installing/Linux_Build>`_.


f. Rllab-multiagent (optional)
==============================
Flow has been tested on a variety of RL libraries, the installation of which is
optional but may be of use when trying to execute some of the examples files
located in Flow. rllab-multiagent is one of these such libraries.  In order
to install the `rllab-multiagent` library, follow the below instructions

::

    cd ~
    git clone https://github.com/cathywu/rllab-multiagent.git
    cd rllab-multiagent
    python setup.py develop

For linux run

::

    echo 'export PYTHONPATH="$HOME/rllab-multiagent:$PYTHONPATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.bashrc

For mac run

::

    echo 'export PYTHONPATH="$HOME/rllab-multiagent:$PYTHONPATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
    source ~/.bash_profile

g. Ray/RLlib (optional)
=======================
RLlib is another RL library that has been extensively tested on the Flow
repository. 
First visit <https://github.com/eugenevinitsky/ray/blob/master/doc/source/installation.rst> and
install the required packages. Do NOT `pip install ray`.

The installation process for this library is as follows:

::

    cd ~
    git clone https://github.com/eugenevinitsky/ray.git
    python ray/python/setup.py develop

If missing libraries cause errors, please also install additional 
required libraries as specified at 
<http://ray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html> and
then follow the setup instructions.


h. Custom configuration
=======================

You may define user-specific config parameters as follows

::

    cp flow/core/config.template.py flow/core/config.py  # Create template for users using pycharm


2. Remote installation using docker
