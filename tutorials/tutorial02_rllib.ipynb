    "# Exercise 02: Running RLlib Experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial walks you through the process of running traffic simulations in Flow with trainable RLlib-powered agents. Autonomous agents will learn to maximize a certain reward over the rollouts, using the [**RLlib**](https://ray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rllib.html) library ([citation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.09381)). Simulations of this form will depict the propensity of RL agents to influence the traffic of a human fleet in order to make the whole fleet more efficient (for some given metrics). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we simulate an initially perturbed single lane ring road, where we introduce a single autonomous vehicle. We witness that, after some training, that the autonomous vehicle learns to dissipate the formation and propagation of \"phantom jams\" which form when only human driver dynamics are involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Components of a Simulation\n",
    "All simulations, both in the presence and absence of RL, require two components: a *scenario*, and an *environment*. Scenarios describe the features of the transportation network used in simulation. This includes the positions and properties of nodes and edges constituting the lanes and junctions, as well as properties of the vehicles, traffic lights, inflows, etc... in the network. Environments, on the other hand, initialize, reset, and advance simulations, and act as the primary interface between the reinforcement learning algorithm and the scenario. Moreover, custom environments may be used to modify the dynamical features of an scenario. Finally, in the RL case, it is in the *environment* that the state/action spaces and the reward function are defined. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Setting up a Scenario\n",
    "Flow contains a plethora of pre-designed scenarios used to replicate highways, intersections, and merges in both closed and open settings. All these scenarios are located in flow/scenarios. For this exercise, which involves a single lane ring road, we will use the scenario `LoopScenario`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Setting up Scenario Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "The scenario mentioned at the start of this section, as well as all other scenarios in Flow, are parameterized by the following arguments: \n",
    "* name\n",
    "* generator_class\n",
    "* vehicles\n",
    "* net_params\n",
    "* initial_config\n",
    "\n",
    "These parameters are explained in detail in exercise 1. Moreover, all parameters excluding vehicles (covered in section 2.2) do not change from the previous exercise. Accordingly, we specify them nearly as we have before, and leave further explanations of the parameters to exercise 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important difference between SUMO and RLlib experiments is that, in RLlib experiments, the scenario classes are not imported, but rather called via their *string* names which (for serializtion and execution purposes) must be located within `flow/scenarios/__init__.py`. To check which scenarios are currently available, we execute the below command."
